## üéØ MISSING FEATURES SUMMARY

Your main project is missing:
- ‚ùå Advanced referral program (10x growth potential)
- ‚ùå Secret management system (security risk)
- ‚ùå Redis caching (performance risk)
- ‚ùå Professional media handling (scalability issue)
- ‚ùå Multi-step onboarding (conversion issue)
- ‚ùå Advanced security middleware (vulnerability risk)
- ‚ùå Social media automation (marketing gap)
- ‚ùå Professional logging (debugging nightmare)

**Bottom Line:** Your main project has the basics but lacks the growth engines and enterprise features found in your other projects. Integrating these could transform Fansworld from a basic platform into a viral, scalable business.
